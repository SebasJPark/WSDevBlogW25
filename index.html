          First week back, and it's already a bit better than last semester. So far, our group has already decided a game genre, 
          theme, and a scope for the whole semester, and things are decently on track. 
          Though most of the time this week was spent in meeting thinking about what to make, 
          and a lot of very base level implementations, we already have something playable. It might not be too clear right now, but we're going for a movement platformer game, 
          inspired by the game Neon White (without the dating sim).

          <br>
          <br>In terms of what I did in a literal sense, I mostly did the groundworks for how player movement will work in our game, 
          with big things like wallrunning and the general POV mechanics, and smaller ones like fine tuning friction and adding slight 
          feedback like speed lines for immersion. It was surprising hard to do smaller details like the acceleration, and I have a feeling that will be the main goal 
          throughout the semester, as a movement game with even slightly subpar feeling movement will not be a good game.

          <br>


          <br>Here's a quick example of what we've got so far, with a level that I made quickly to give idea of what we want the game to feel like. (I swear that last jump is really hard)

            These weeks mainly consisted of the second layer of requirements for our game, including things like UI, level transitions, and our abilities. 
            We completed most of our abilities recently, and though they don't have art just yet, they have mostly fun implementations. Good news is that the game is actually pretty fun to play right now,
             bad news is that I sometimes find myself just playing the game instead of working on it.
  
  
          <br>
          <br>In terms of specifics, what I worked on recently was mainly the grappling hook, which took a lot of fine tuning to get it to feel right. As you'd imagine, it's pretty finicky, and I 
          expect it to take a good amount of time and more work to get it to feel really right. Here is a quick video of the grappling hook I took.
  
          <br>

          </video>
  
  
          <br>
          Another thing I worked on, which you can see above, is levels. This is pretty much the only other thing we need to do (aside from art implementations) to get an actual playable game. Once we have those, 
          although a bit rough around the edges, we can playtest and get more feedback on what feels good or bad. This ended up being something that took a decent amount more time than I expected, and honestly 
          a bit unproductive as often times I'd end up working on something, then change an ability or something with movement, and it'd require alteration. This is something that I think will be 
          consistent throughout the Development unfortunately as we'll always want to keep changing abilities to be more fun, and levels will have to follow.
          <br>
          
          <br>
  
          Last thing I really worked on these past two weeks was UI, and though not finished, it gives the general idea of what we want to do, and I think it actually looks pretty good. It gives us level transitions and 
          helps give the idea of the general game loop we're looking for.

            This last week was spring break, basically meaning that nothing of note got done for it. To be completely honest, this was also just a generally unproductive time aside from that. I essentially only worked on tweaking the grappling hook just a bit,
             with a bit of level design in there (which I mainly worked during team meetings). The rest of the time these last 2 weeks was essentially just planning for the future.
  
  
          <br>
          <br>For what we intend to do in the future (which is basically what we did), we are thinking that we will be first implementing art, then getting a main menu that lets you choose between worlds (like the current hub world we have that should be world 1), and then making the levels, and after that we essentially have the game done (or at least in a generally completed protoytype state).

            This last week mainly was GDC attendance, which was really fun and fairly useful! I met with a lot of people (most of them in a pretty rough spot like me though), and learned
             a good amount about the games industry. Overall a pretty good experience, though it was a bit rough on my sleep schedule and social battery.

            I've been fairly burnt out lately, as well as quite busy, so I didn't quite get much done to be honest unfortunately, but there is still some stuff to show for it.
            <br>
            <br>The major thing I got going was the art implementation for hands, which helps player immersion a lot, and makes it a lot more fun to be honest.
            <br>
            <br>Aside from that, all I really did was mess around with trying to get new levels completed, which was a fun process, but I need to focus more on getting key aspects of the game completed
            like UI elements and polishing our current levels. As this is just a prototype, we need to get the proof that this is a fun game with potential, and we definitely have the fun part down, we just need to get more obvious 
            examples of our design process to show what we would want a final product to look like.

            With just a few days left til expo, I think we're in a pretty good spot. We've gotten a mostly complete build that I think will be fun for people to play, and even if it doesn't win I think it's been a great experience!
            <br>
            <br>This week I mainly worked on a few levels, with a good amount of smaller tweaks to gameplay. Though not all of them are all that visible, some major ones are some new levels, a local (very much so) best time feature, better sprites and lighting implementation, the speedometer, and a general structure between stages themselves.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>This video should showcase a good amount of the changes I've made, with a general feel for how the gameplay will look during the showcase.
