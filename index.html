          First week back, and it's already a bit better than last semester. So far, our group has already decided a game genre, 
          theme, and a scope for the whole semester, and things are decently on track. 
          Though most of the time this week was spent in meeting thinking about what to make, 
          and a lot of very base level implementations, we already have something playable. It might not be too clear right now, but we're going for a movement platformer game, 
          inspired by the game Neon White (without the dating sim).

          <br>
          <br>In terms of what I did in a literal sense, I mostly did the groundworks for how player movement will work in our game, 
          with big things like wallrunning and the general POV mechanics, and smaller ones like fine tuning friction and adding slight 
          feedback like speed lines for immersion. It was surprising hard to do smaller details like the acceleration, and I have a feeling that will be the main goal 
          throughout the semester, as a movement game with even slightly subpar feeling movement will not be a good game.

          <br>


          <br>Here's a quick example of what we've got so far, with a level that I made quickly to give idea of what we want the game to feel like. (I swear that last jump is really hard)
